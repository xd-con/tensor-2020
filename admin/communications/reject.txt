Subject: Tensor Developer Summit

Dear colleague,

We have completed our selection for the Tensor Developer Summit.
Unfortunately, we will not be able to offer you a spot at this year's
event.

We had many great applicants whose voices could have added to the
conversation, but our venue only allows for a small number of
participants.

We thank you kindly for your interest.

Best regards,
St√©fan
