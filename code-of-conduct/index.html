  <p>The community of participants of ImageXD is made up of members from
around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and
experiences. It is through these differences that our community
experiences success and continued growth. We expect everyone in our
community to follow these guidelines when interacting with others both
inside and outside of our community. Our goal is to keep ours a
positive, inclusive, successful, and growing community.</p>
<p>As members of the community,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment-
and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation,

language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary
jokes are not appropriate.</p>

acknowledged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the community, and
realize that including people with a variety of opinions and
backgrounds will only serve to enrich our community. In particular,
discussions relating to pros/cons of various technologies,
programming languages, and so on are welcome, but these should be
done with respect, taking proactive measure to ensure that all
participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely
express their opinions.</p>

respect as people within our community.</p>

<p>We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct,
and to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of
conduct.  We will take action when members of our community violate
this code such as notifying a workshop organizer or talking

<p>This code of conduct applies to all community situations online and
offline, including the conference itself, mailing lists, forums,
